$${\color{purple}× . ˋ 🌺Just⠀doing⠀my⠀part ゛ ᵎᵎ}$$

>> Hello, this is bassie, you can find me in docks, dw spot, or a lab/dw roleplay!!
>>
>> Feel free to interact with me if you want, unless I'm nonverbal or uncomfy due to something
>
> I don't mind if you wanna crown me or compliment me, I have the chance to say thanks!!
>
> I'll compliment any Easter toon skins, no matter if it's bad or good !! ( I like Easter toons !! ) 
>
> if I suddenly go off and then back, I was stalking someone's socials to read BYI and boundaries, or my wifi is bad
>
> ask me if you wanted to do a rp ship, Ill say yes, but won't be good at ship stuff...
>
> I'm very insecure at times... as you know I am a DW fan myself, and sometimes I became too free with my interests, which lead to someone people having reminders. ( also a sensitive person when it comes to insults)
